If there is ever a conflict between commitments with your life’s priorities and work, life should come first. In this spirit, we offer an unlimited vacation policy and the autonomy for employees to take leave whenever necessary. Employees know themselves best; hence they are well-equipped to decide how they want to work and deliver excellent results.'

We are a highly motivated group of people. As a result, we want high performance from our employees and collaborators. We hire only the best-fit candidates so that we can maximize social impact. Being thoughtful about what kind of people we hire and the flexibility to adjust if employee or company performance is mismatched helps us build an effective company culture that can accelerate social change.'
