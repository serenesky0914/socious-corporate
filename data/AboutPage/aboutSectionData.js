    content: `In existing social media platforms, your content is censored by a central authority and your data is being collected and sold without consent. On Socious, the community members collectively decide, through a democratic decision-making process, which content is for social good and which organizations are socially conscious without a central authority. You - not those companies - are the owner of your data and you can sell it to whomever you please through our blockchain-based decentralized platform (Dapp) in a secure manner. Your data is securely stored on a blockchain and, if you wish, you can choose to sell it to advertisers/researchers via smart contracts.`
