          Do you have a passion for social impact? If yes, Socious Inc. is looking for somebody with your enthusiasm and skills to work as part of the team. We are looking for an experienced developer who is curious, driven, and passionate about social impact. If you are looking for a role where you can make a major impact in the world, we want to meet you.
          <br /><br />
          Socious is a community app for social change, powered by AI and blockchain. Many people are interested in contributing to social impact projects, but few of them can do so. We leverage
          this untapped potential by helping them contribute to society in an easy, fun way through a purpose-driven community
          app, AI recommendations, and blockchain-based community currency. We are developing a decentralized application (Dapp) where users can take control of and monetize their content and data.
          <br /><br />
          We started Socious in July 2021, so as an early employee you’ll be pivotal in shaping the direction of the company. We
          have enough runway to last us through the end of 2022, and are about to close a seed round to allow us to accelerate
          even faster.
          <br /><br />
          You’ll be able to work fully remotely, though we'll meet up in person several times per year, so we're looking for
          someone living in Japan. If you aren't here yet, that's fine: you’ll be able to work remotely until we help you secure a
          working visa.
          <br /><br />
          We communicate in English, and so no Japanese ability is required, though there will be opportunities to use Japanese if
          you’d like to.
          <br /><br />
          You will be working with a team of talented developers (one full-time employee + several freelancers).
          <br /><br />
          In this role, you’ll work closely with senior stakeholders to understand business goals and ensure that the development
          team & technologies used are aligned with these.
